dest - Deployment State Manager

dest is a simple "deployment state" change management tool. Inspired by
what Sqitch does for databases, it provides a simple mechanism for writing
deploy, verify, and revert parts of a change action. The typical use of
dest is in a development context because it allows for simplified state
changes when switching between branches (as an example).

Let's say you're working with a group of other software engineers on a
particular software project using your favorite revision control system.
Let's also say that you have a database that undergoes schema changes as
features are developed, and you have various system activities like the
installation of libraries or other applications. Then let's also say the team
braches, works on stuff, shares those branches, reverts, merges, etc. And also
from time to time you want to go back in time a bit so you can reproduce a bug.
Maintaining the database state and the state of the system across all that
activity can be problematic. dest tries to solve this in a very simple way,
letting you be able to deploy, revert, and verify to any point in time in
the development history.

Using dest for production deployment, provisioning, or configuration management
is not advised. Use something like Angular et al instead. Angular (or whatever
CM tool you prefer) can use dest to perform some actions.
