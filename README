depst - Deployment State Manager

depst is a simple "deployment state" change management tool. I really like
what Sqitch is doing, but I wanted something that worked on more than just
databases. And I'm not very smart, so I wanted something really simple.
(Both simple to use and simple to maintain.) Thus, depst was born.

Let's say you're working with a group of other software engineers on a
particular software project using your favorite revision control system.
Let's also say that you have a database that undergoes schema changes as
features are developed, and you have various system activities like the
installation of libraries or other applications. Then let's also say the team
braches, works on stuff, shares those branches, reverts, merges, etc. And also
from time to time you want to go back in time a bit so you can reproduce a bug.
Maintaining the database state and the state of the system across all that
activity can be problematic. depst tries to solve this in a very simple way,
letting you be able to deploy, revert, and verify to any point in time in
the development history.
